# *Word-Clock*

Have your clock tell you the time in full written sentences by lighting up hidden words in a grid of random letters. The face can also be easily swapped once complete to give it almost any style or look you like. The Word Clock uses a Real Time Clock module to read the current time & toggle individual LEDs within an LED Matrix. Each individual LED corresponds to specific written sentence.
